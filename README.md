# photo-reviewer

This is a lightweight app for reviewing my photos from Photos.app.
I can navigate and review photos entirely using my keyboard.

This video shows you how I use it:

I can use the following commands:

*   ⬅️ / ➡️ – navigate back and forth
*   1️⃣ – approve the photo, which adds it to the "Approved" album
*   2️⃣ – reject the photo, which adds it to the "Rejected" album
*   3️⃣ – add the photo to the "Needs Action" album
*   `f` – mark the photo as a favourite
*   `c` – add the photo to my "Cross stitch" album
*   `o` – open the photo in Photos.app

## Motivation

When I take photos, I often take a lot of similar shots so that I'm more likely to get a good picture.
This means I have a growing photo library full of pictures which are blurry/similar/duplicates – I'd like to filter down to just the best version of each shot.

A while back I tried using [Darkroom] and their [Flag & Reject workflow].
I like the idea, and I used it for a while, but the app was very buggy and slow on my Mac – it would sometimes crash, sometimes take 10+ seconds to switch between photos.

This app is my replacement for the reviewing portion of Darkroom – I can switch between photos quickly, and control it entirely using the keyboard.
