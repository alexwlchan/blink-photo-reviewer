# photo-reviewer

This is a lightweight app for reviewing my photos from Photos.app.
I can navigate and review photos entirely using my keyboard.

In this demo video, I use the arrow keys to quickly switch between two photos and compare them (a ["blink diff"][blink_diff]), then I type `2` to reject one photo and `1` to approve another.
When I move to the next photo, I type `f` to mark it as a favourite.
